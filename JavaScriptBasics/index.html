            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul id="secondary">
                <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for sorting data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>
                <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assignds a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
                <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are inportant concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - nullo aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'] and Object - {first name: 'Jane, last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
                <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
